## Hi there 👋, I'm Sparsh Srivastava 👦.

### About me
I'm a hacker 💻, believer 😃 and dreamer 💭 


I believe in clean coding and slick design. Building astonishing apps is my passion, hearing compliments is my pleasure. Users demand cool products to use instead of sloppy ones, so I work with that purpose.

Nowadays I'm curious about different architectures, complex animations, and using machine learning in apps.

Since I am an avid believer of phrase "Learn something new everyday!", I keep educating myself on various topics such as user experiences, edge computing, serverless backends, and cyber security etc. That's helping me to broaden my vision and lets me able to see within the user perspective beyond the technical capabilities.
